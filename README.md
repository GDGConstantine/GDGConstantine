# Hi there, This is GDG Constantine 👋

## 👨‍💻 Google Developer Groups - Constantine Chapter

### 📌 About GDG

Google Developer Groups (GDGs) are for developers who are interested in Google's developer technology; everything from the Android, Chrome, Drive, and Google Cloud platforms, to product APIs like the Cast API, Maps API, and YouTube API. A GDG can take many forms -- from just a few people getting together to watch our latest video, to large gatherings with demos and tech talks, to events like code sprints and hackathons. However, at the core, GDGs are focused on developers and technical content, and the core audience should be developers.

### 📌 Description of GDG Constantine Community

GDG Constantine is a local community situated at the Faculty of NTIC of Université Abdelhamid Mehri-Constantine 2, Constantine.
We are part of the big global community of developers called "Google Developers Group" (over 960 communities worldwide).
Our community is made up of passionate, ambitious, and dedicated developers as well as motivated young students.
*** It was created in the last quarter of 2012, and it aims to improve the student developer environment and community in Constantine.

### 📌 Mission of GDG Constantine Community

Our mission is to bridge the gap between people who are eager to get their hands on the latest technologies, skill sets, and knowledge of the tech ecosystem in general.
GDG Constantine Chapter hosts a variety of technical activities for developers through the different events we organize, aiming to help the developer community get the latest technology updates.
We aim to impact every member significantly in different aspects of their career paths, such as,

- Professional development through the conferences that we do in collaboration with several experienced experts in different fields

- Educational and cultural activities such as workshops are used to bring students closer together and provide them with the opportunity to open up in the professional world and network more effectively.

- We help bring resources and activities closer that will aid in skill improvement, which, in turn, helps broaden their horizons of knowledge.

- We encourage valuing the spirit of collective work, thus ensuring quality training, promoting exchanges, and sharing ideas.
